The portfolio project is a well-structured and functional platform designed to showcase 
professional skills, achievements, and projects while providing an interactive and user
friendly experience. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Java, and Spring Boot, it 
ensures a responsive and dynamic interface for visitors. 

The integration of a contact form with backend support allows seamless communication, 
with user inquiries being securely stored in a database. Additionally, the project follows 
a clean architecture with frontend and backend separation, ensuring maintainability and 
scalability. 

By implementing modern web technologies and best practices, the portfolio enhances 
professional visibility and engagement. Future enhancements, such as adding interactive 
elements, improved security, and real-time content updates, can further improve its 
functionality.
